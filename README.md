If you wish to run this application from eclipse or other IDE, please import the forms_rt-6.0.5.jar file we have provided in the zip folder. We also have a .png file. If the code is being run directly from IntelliJ, the forms_rt-6.0.5.jar file will not be needed.

The .form file can be opened in IntelliJ so you can see the inner workings of that Framework, but the code will run with or without this file in Eclipse.

ALSO, Our application runs from the command line, but for the sake of UI design, we have also added a "Main Menu"
where you can more easily alter the parameters of the game. We have done all error checking required through both the Command Prompt
and the Main Menu.
